I was the instructor of record for this course on three separate occasions, starting in Spring 2024. For each session, I supervised 2-4 course assistants. 

I structured the course each session, created assignments, and facilitated class discussions. I provided introductory lectures for students each week, on top of the other class materials they had access to. I provided hands-on honors projects for select honors students, working with them throughout the session to complete their goals.
