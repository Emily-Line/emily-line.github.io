I was a teaching assistant for the required graduate course Quantitative Analysis II for one semester. These responsibilities included grading homework and exams, answering students questions, and transitioning the classroom to online during the Covid-19 pandemic. I also assisted students with software and analyses during the lab portions of the class.
