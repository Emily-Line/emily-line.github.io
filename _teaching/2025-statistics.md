I have served as the primary instructor and as the lab teaching assistant for this course.

I lectured students on introductory statistics topics, including probability, hypothesis testing, power, t-tests, and regression. I developed multiple assignments and materials for the course. 

Teaching Assistant (Fall 2025)

I hold weekly lab sessions in which I review materials from lecture, do practice problems with students, and hold Q\&A sessions.
