I was the instructor of record for this course on four separate occasions, starting in Summer 2023. For each session, I supervised 2-5 course assistants. 

I structured the course each session, taking into account feedback from previous courses. I created assignments, structured exams, and provided students with introductory lectures each week. I worked with select students on unique honors projects that we tailored to their interests.
