In this workshop I considered 28 competing hypotheses stemming from interrogation literature. These hypotheses made predictions about mock interrogators' judgments and decisions based on several features about a suspect. 
I presented summary information about these competing models, including model parsimony and different specifications of models. After I revealed the winning model, workshop participants discussed implications for the field.
