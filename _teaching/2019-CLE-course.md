This was a Continuing Legal Education (CLE) course that was attended by roughly 200 attorneys. In this course, I described the features of a psychological assessment tool that are crucial in evaluating its reliability, validity, error rate, and general acceptance in the field. These are all factors that attorneys and judges should take into account when making admissibility-related decisions for evidence in court.
