In this workshop I introduced the analysis framework termed "order-constrained inference" using examples from psychology and law. I described how to translate verbal hypotheses to mathematical order constraints, provided an example of this method using a secondary analysis, and demonstrated how to analyze these mathematical models using open-source software.
