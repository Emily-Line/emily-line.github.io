excerpt: 'In three experiments, we observed that people form similar representations of state- and trait-based passages as reflected by their performance in two recognition tasks and a free-recall task. However, a fourth experiment suggested that participants’ memories of the exact syntax they read are not so degraded that they are unable to recover what they read when explicitly prompted. '
