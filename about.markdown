## Emily Line

I am a PhD student in Quantitative Psychology at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I use mathematical and computational modeling to study decision-making across a range of contexts. 
My research focuses on how people integrate (potentially faulty) information into their judgments and strategies. I have applied these approaches to topics in health, 
economics, and psychology and law. 

I am committed to making technical tools and methods accessible to the broader community. My efforts include leading workshops on advanced mathematical modeling techniques, writing tutorials on translating verbal theories
into formal models, and contributing to software that streamlines model specification and analysis. 

I anticipate to graduate from the University of Illinoi, Urbana-Champaign with my PhD in Psychology in May 2026. I graduated with my M.S. in Statistics in 2023 at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I received my M.S. in Psychology at Arizona State University in 2020. I earned my B.S. in Psychology, with a minor in Mathematics, from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Stout in 2018.
